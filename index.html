<h2>Amnesiac Wizard</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Walking through the city trying to find the owner of the cell phone.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player can walk through the city trying to catch the owner of the cell phone.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Camera centering and non-fixed background
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You could follow the typical rules of navigating a city, or you could break them. It's reckless to break them.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in an urban city. It's not in the real world, as there are some features you don't normally see in real life.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You're walking down the street, when you accidentally bump into someone. You try to give an apology, but the stranger appears to be in a hurry. As he walks away, you notice something on the ground. It appears to be the person's cell phone, which was accidentally dropped when you crashed into the person. You decide to chase after the person and try to return the cell phone.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People looking for a casual game. There isn't much action to be had, apart from avoiding obstacles.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as it takes to reach the person, or until the timer runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
People aren't dangerous. Cars and some other objects are.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch. Music from Animal Crossing: Wild World was used as background music, and a sound was downloaded to be used as the magic casting sound
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It's similar to Frogger, where the player can cross busy streets while trying to avoid cars. Of course, the player could wait until they stop too.
